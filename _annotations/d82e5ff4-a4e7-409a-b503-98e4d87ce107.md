The natural signs placed before these two notes are unnecessary; they have no effect on the notes as sung, given the song's A minor key. The composer of the alto part—new to *Original Sacred Harp*—may have intended to place sharp signs before these notes, yet this would introduce a discord against the tenor and bass in the second of the pair. The editors of the 1936 *Original Sacred Harp: Denson Revision* removed both natural signs.

The repeat markers at the end of this measure send singers back to an incomplete measure at the song's midpoint. The song should feature first and second endings with a half-note length first ending. The 1870 Fourth Edition of *The Sacred Harp* featured just a single incomplete half-note measure as an ending. This error, introduced in *Original Sacred Harp*, persists in *The Sacred Harp: 1991 Edition*.
